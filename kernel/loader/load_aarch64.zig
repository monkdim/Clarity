//! Loading an ELF into an AArch64 process's address space.
//!
//! The counterpart to load.zig, and deliberately not a copy of it: the part
//! that walks a segment page by page, zeroes each frame, maps it and copies
//! the file-backed bytes lives in segments.zig and is the same code both
//! architectures run. What is here is what actually differs — how a page is
//! mapped (paging.zig rather than vmm.zig), where the kernel reaches physical
//! memory, and the two things this architecture needs that x86_64 does not.
//!
//! Those two are worth naming. The kernel writes a program's instructions
//! through the data cache and EL0 fetches them through the instruction cache,
//! which knows nothing about the stores — so every executable page has to be
//! made coherent before it is run. And the mapped pages have to be tracked to
//! be freed, because paging.destroy frees the tables and deliberately not the
//! memory they point at: the tables are the address space's, the frames are
//! whoever allocated them.
