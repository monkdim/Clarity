//! The x86_64 user-memory layer: every address a process hands the kernel
//! goes through here, and the kernel never dereferences one itself.
//!
//! A system call arrives with pointers that mean something only in the
//! calling process's address space, and that the process may be lying
//! about. Until this existed, sys_read, sys_write and sys_open cast the
//! argument to a pointer and used it: a bad one was a page fault in the
//! kernel, which halts the machine, rather than an EFAULT the program gets
//! back. A pointer into the kernel's own half would have been read or
//! written on the program's behalf.
//!
//! aarch64 answers the question with hardware: `at s1e0r` and `at s1e0w`
//! translate an address exactly as EL0 would and say whether it faults.
//! x86_64 has no such instruction, so this walks the page tables the MMU
//! would walk, from the CR3 that is loaded (the calling process's, since a
//! system call runs on its CR3), and applies the same rule the CPU applies:
//! a user access is allowed only if every level on the path is present and
//! user-accessible, and a write only if every level is writable as well.
//! A huge page ends the walk early, the way it ends the CPU's.
//!
//! The copy itself then goes through the direct map of the physical frame,
//! page by page, because two consecutive user pages are two unrelated
//! frames. The kernel therefore touches no user virtual address at all,
//! which is what lets SMAP be switched on: with CR4.SMAP set, a kernel
//! access to a user page through its user address is a fault, so any
//! path that still did that would show up as a crash under `-cpu max`
//! rather than as silent permissiveness.
